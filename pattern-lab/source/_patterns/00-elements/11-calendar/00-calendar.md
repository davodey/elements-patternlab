Included in elements CSS

This component defines the standard visual style for the calendar element. Cells or dates which have visual highlighting or other states conveyed via a purely visual manner must also include a textual version of that information using the pe-sr-only class. Note the space between the date number and the hidden text; this is to prevent assistive technology from running the date and the first hidden word together. A newline character is also acceptable.
