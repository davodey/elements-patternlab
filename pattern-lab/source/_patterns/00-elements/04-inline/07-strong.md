Included in elements CSS


Use the <strong> element when you want to give text strong importance with respect to other text in the same context.


The <b> and <strong> elements are similar. However, bold is a physical state that represents both the content and its presentation, while strong is a logical state that separates the content from its presentationâ€”it indicates that, in the current context, the text is more important than the surrounding text.
