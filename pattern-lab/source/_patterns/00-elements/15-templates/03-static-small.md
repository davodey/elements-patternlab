Included in elements CSS

The static column presents a single column of fixed width which is centered in the page. At smaller breakpoints it transitions to full width fluid behavior. This column comes in two different sizes (small at 480px and large at 800px) and is handy for presenting modals or small pieces of content like sign in forms.

Dimensions:

The large size is 800px wide at large breakpoints and larger
The small size is 480px wide at medium breakpoints and larger
Responsive:

Below the breakpoints mentioned above, both sizes become 10 grid columns wide and centered
Below the small breakpoint both sizes become the full 12 column width
