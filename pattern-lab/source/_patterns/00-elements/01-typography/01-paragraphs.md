Paragraphs should naturally have the default body copy styles, but if they inherit other styles, the pe-paragraph class references them as well. The final paragraph of a block of content should have no bottom margin, which can be set using the pe-paragraph--last class.


This style also represents the basic body copy styles for a document.
